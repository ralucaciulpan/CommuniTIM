# CommuniTIM
We created CommuniTIM to help the citizens of Timi»ôoara. CommuniTIM is an application that speeds up the process of reporting issues of different kinds along with their location and description.

After you create an account, you will be able to report a problem or support someone else's report of a problem. When a certain problem reaches a big enough number of sustainers, an e-mail with all the details provided will be sent to the City Hall.

The app will keep you updated and notify you when the problem you reported or you sustained has been solved.
